The state of social media frankly pisses me the fuck off. Twitter is a Nazi hellscape, Bluesky is <em>ok</em> I guess and I'll probably stick around there too, but nobody can stop me here so I get to make it a cool place the way I want it.</p>\n<p>Who knows what I'll post about? It will likely just be mundane things about my life; hobbies, cool things I see or do, and probably some tech and game dev stuff when I find the time for it.</p>\n<p>So come hang out and learn more about me! ðŸ’–ðŸŒ¿</p>",
